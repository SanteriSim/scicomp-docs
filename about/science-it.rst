Science-IT (Aalto HPC)
======================

Computational research is one of the focus areas in Aalto
University. The Science-IT project was founded in 2009 to facilitate
the computational infrastructure needed in top-tier scientific
research. Many Centres of Excellence and departments at Aalto
University are using our  resources with great success. There are
currently about 600 users from five different schools and at least 14
different departments using our resources. Science-IT is administered
from the School of Science, and direct Aalto level funding enables use
of our resources from all Aalto University, free of charge.

Our services
------------

In Science-IT, we concentrate on mid-range computing and special
resources needed by researchers in the School of Science. With local
resources, we can provide high-quality support and even
research-project-level customization.  Because our resources are
integrated into the Aalto IT environment, with regular local training
in the scientific computing practice to entry-level users, our
resources enjoy an ease of access and lower barrier to entry than, for
example, CSC HPC resources. We are also a basic research
infrastructure, enabling the integration of separately purchased
resources to our cluster and storage environments, with dedicated
access for the purchaser.

Our team is mainly known for providing the :doc:`Triton cluster </triton/index>`, a mid-range
HPC cluster with several thousand CPUs, 2PB storage capacity,
Infiniband network, and many GPUs for deep learning and artificial
intelligence research.  We provide a :doc:`Jupyter Notebook </triton/apps/jupyter>` based interface
to enable light computing with less initial knowledge required to make
our services easily accessible to everyone.  Our team also works with
the CS, NBE, and PHYS departments to provide :doc:`HTCondor
</aalto/htcordor>` (high throughput
computing), data storage, and a seamless computational research
experience.  We maintain http://scicomp.aalto.fi, the central hub for
scientific computing instructions and have a continuous :doc:`training
program </training/index>`, :doc:`Scientific Computing in Practice <news>`.

Current research areas
----------------------
* Method development
* Computational materials research
* Network research
* Neuroscience
* Data mining
* Deep learning and artificial intelligence
* Big data analysis

Scientific outputs
------------------
Most of the computationally-intensive research outputs from our member
departments use our resources.  In addition, at least the CS and NBE
departments use our data storage for most big data projects.  You may
view the our research results using `research.aalto.fi`__ (Science-IT
infrastructure section).

Collaborations
--------------

Science-IT serves as the hub of large scale computational and
data-intensive research at Aalto.  As such, we maintain many active
collaborations which allow us to guide researchers to the right
resource, regardless of who provides it.

We are a leading member of the `Finnish Grid and Cloud Infrastructure <fgci_>`_
(FGCI), a university consortium to support mid-range computing in
universities.  FGCI, via Academy of Finland research infrastructure
grants, funds a large portion of our work.  Thus, we maintain ties to
most other universities in Finland as well as CSC, the national
academic computing center.  Through the FGCI, we provide grid
computing access across all of Finland and Europe.

Our team overlaps with the Departments of Computer Science,
Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering, and Applied Physics.

We maintain close collaboration with **Aalto University IT Services
(ITS)**.  We are not a part of ITS, but work closely with them as the
computational arm of  IT Services.  ITS provides the base which we
repackage and build on for many of our services.

Our team maintains ties to **Aalto Research and Innovation Services
(RIS)** to guide data and research policy.  Triton is an Aalto-level
research infrastructure.

We partner with `CodeRefinery <https://coderefinery.org/>`_, a Nordic
consortium to assist in training of scientists, to provide training
and support computational competence.
