About Aalto Scientific Computing
================================

Computational research is one of the focus areas in Aalto
University, and **Aalto Scientific Computing** makes that possible.

The **Science-IT** project was founded in 2009 (with roots going back
much further) and has since expanded from high-performance computing
services to a complete package: we provide computation, data
management, software, and training.  Our partnerships with departments
and central IT services allow a streamlined experience from personal
devices to the largest clusters.

To reflect our expanded services, we have rebranded to **Aalto
Scientific Computing** to reflect our greater mission and partners.

Many Centres of Excellence and departments at Aalto
University are using our resources with great success. There are
currently about 600 users from all six different schools and at least 14
different departments using our resources. Science-IT is administered
from the School of Science with additional university-level funding -
**our HPC services are available to all Aalto University, free of charge**.


Our partners and collaborators
------------------------------

**Aalto Scientific Computing** serves as a hub of all computational
science at Aalto.

Science-IT serves as the coordinatior, and runs the Triton cluster,
the hub of large scale computational and data-intensive research at
Aalto.  As such, we maintain many active collaborations which allow us
to guide researchers to the right resource, regardless of who provides
it.

We are a leading member of the **Finnish Grid and Cloud Infrastructure
(FGCI)**, a university consortium to support mid-range computing in
universities.  FGCI, via Academy of Finland research infrastructure
grants, funds a large portion of our work.  Thus, we maintain ties to
most other universities in Finland as well as CSC, the national
academic computing center.  Through the FGCI, we provide grid
computing access across all of Finland and Europe.

Our team overlaps with the `Departments of Computer Science
<https://cs.aalto.fi/en/>`_, `Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering
<http://nbe.aalto.fi/en/>`_, and `Applied Physics
<http://physics.aalto.fi/en/>`_.  The IT groups in these departments

We maintain close collaboration with **Aalto University IT Services
(ITS)**.  We are not a part of ITS, but work closely with them as the
computational arm of IT Services.  ITS provides the base which we
repackage and build on for many of our services.

Our team maintains ties to **Aalto Research and Innovation Services**
to guide data and research policy.  Triton is an Aalto-level research
infrastructure.

We partner with `CodeRefinery <https://coderefinery.org/>`_, a Nordic
consortium to assist in training of scientists, to provide training
and support computational competence.


Science-IT
~~~~~~~~~~

In Science-IT, we concentrate on mid-range computing and special
resources needed by researchers in the School of Science. With local
resources, we can provide high-quality support and even
research-project-level customization.  Because our resources are
integrated into the Aalto IT environment, with regular local training
in the scientific computing practice to entry-level users, our
resources enjoy an ease of access and lower barrier to entry than, for
example, CSC HPC resources. We are also a basic research
infrastructure, enabling the integration of separately purchased
resources to our cluster and storage environments, with dedicated
access for the purchaser.

Computer Science, Physics, and Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering

These departments are members of Science-IT, and their local IT staff
provide the greatest Science-IT support.

Scientific outputs
------------------

Most of the computationally-intensive research outputs from our member
departments use our resources.  In addition, at least the CS and NBE
departments use our data storage for most big data projects.  You may
view the our research results using `research.aalto.fi (Science-IT
infrastructure section
<https://research.aalto.fi/en/equipment/scienceit(27991559-92d9-4b3b-95ee-77147899d043)/publications.html>`_).
